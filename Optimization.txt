Two optimization methods were used:
- Indexes (in SQL)
- Prepared Statements (inserting the DB)

Initially before using these optimization methods the XML parsers ran for:
Movie Parser: ~3:40 minutes
Star Parser: ~1:30 minutes
Cast Parser: ~4:30 minutes

After optimization:
Movie Parser: ~1:40 minutes
Star Parser: ~45 Seconds
Cast Parser: ~2:40 minutes
