    <h1> Like-Predicate </h1>
    <div class='box'>
    <ul class='list'>
        <li>Search
        <ul>
            <li>
            Used the LIKE predicate for all the search parameters (title, director, star, year).
            </li>
            <li>
            The pattern was %ABC%, the reason for this was so that the users input would be matched with any attribute of a movie because the user may not know the exact spelling of the title or the name of the director or star.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Browse (Title)
            <ul>
            <li>
            Used the pattern a% with a LIKE predicate since the user knows what the first character of the movie theyâ€™re looking for is.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Browse (Genre)
            <ul>
            <li>
            A LIKE predicate with the pattern %genre% was required while browsing with genre since the genre were put together using a group_concat.
            </li>
            <li>
            Thus without a LIKE predicate only the movies that had just one genre would show up. Thus using a LIKE predicate even the movies that had more than one genre would show up.
            </li>
            <li>
            It was not required for the single movie or single star as the exact term being searched for was known.
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </div>
